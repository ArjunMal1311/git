Version Control System

System that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later
Recorded in repository
Local, Centralized and Distributed VCS

Local - Stored on System
Centralized - Central server is used to store files and is connected to each programmer
Distributed - Everyone has their own local copy and they can push commit to the main repository

In Centralized, worker will push directly to the server so if there is any error then it will be time
consuming process to go back. In Distributed, worker will firsty commit to local then if he/she is 
satisfied then they can push to main repository

Why VCS?
1. Collaboration
2. Rollback
3. Analyze and compare versions
4. Manage versions
5. Reduce downtime

One of the most popular VCS is git

Git is Distributed VCS, provides data assurance for developing quality. Let so many developers work on files
and easily merge their changes into one source
(Fast)

Repository is a directory or storage space where projects can live. Folder on computer or online host (Github)

Github
(Open Source, Economical, Snapshots, Distributed, Speed, Robustness, Branching, Integriy[No changes can be made without Git recording])

master branch contains publishable code
any experimental thing can be done on another branch
